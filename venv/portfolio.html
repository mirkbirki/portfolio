        <p class="p1">A simple project which I launched in 2003. Me and some pals from university pulled this of
            during an all nighter. We were a bit drunk at the time but somehow we managed to pull it off.<br>
            <br>The site offers users to stay in touch with friends and family from all over the world (where internet
            connection is provided.</p>

        <p class="p1">So, my uncle from Zahaq asked me to make a website for his upcoming idea. His idea was to provide
            cost efficient financial services for consumers in the US. I hesitated to get involved, but looking back I
            don't
            regret it for one second.<br>
            <br>The site made us billionares, so now we can buy that big bottle of JÃ¤germeister.</p></section>
